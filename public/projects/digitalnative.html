                    <h3>Scenario</h3>
                    <p>As part of their online offer, a training business wants to be able to validate a subscriber’s name, 
                        email address and credit card number when they book a course.
                        The commercial director, marketing director and CTO were identified as stakeholders for this app
                        and identified the User Stories in Appendix A:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Review the User Stories in Appendix A</li>
                    </ol>
                    <div class="profile">
                    <img src="../../assets/portfolio/web design/digital native/appendixA.png" alt="list of requirements" height="800px">
                </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Often User Stories are missing all the information a developer needs to develop a solution. These 
                        situations can be tracked through issues or by arranging a session to discuss the user stories to get 
                        clarification. </p>
                  <ol start="2">
                     <li>Record the issues you can find in the User Stories</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>If we cannot get answers from the stakeholders, then we can use assumptions to carry on 
                    developing.</p>
                  <ol start="3">
                     <li>Record the assumptions you need to make to allow you to carry on developing</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Once we have identified the issues, made assumptions about the areas where we don’t have enough 
                    information, we are ready to start thinking about our solution.<br>
                    Often, developers will identify the tests that their code needs to pass to be considered working. This 
                    approach is called Test Driven Development.<br>
                    Test cases are used to define the tests that we will execute to prove we have developed a solution 
                    that meets the User Story Requirements. These can be grouped into a test suite. </p>
                    <ol start="4">
                        <li>Create a suite of tests that the solution must pass to be 
                            considered working.</li><br>
                        <li>Development time: using just a text editor and a browser create your solution. </li><br>
                        <li>Add a copy of the .html .css and .js file to a zip and email it with your other responses.</li><br>
                        <li>Update your test results as you develop, you can show when tests fail. (It really is OK), just 
                            add a new line underneath the test and note the change you made to the code. This will 
                            show how you’ve repeated the Dev / Test cycle till all tests are passed. </li><br>
                        <li>Reflect on the activity:
                            <ul> <br>
                                <li>How was working from User Stories?</li>

                                <li>How was TDD?</li>
                                <li>What have you learned?</li>
                                <li>What would you do differently?
                                </li>
                            </ul>
